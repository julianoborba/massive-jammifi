# massive-jammifi

Nothing interesthing here... I'm trying to shut up anyone nearby that is playing any kind of stream like Spotify or Netflix with loud sound late night. Well, it works.

Have a gnome-terminal installed and just run ./massivejamming.sh.

You may need to adjust some vars.

This prank is child of [this](https://github.com/julianoborba/jammifi).
